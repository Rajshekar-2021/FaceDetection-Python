### To use this code, we need to install opencv-python and mediapipe



This repository contains "2" files :
```bash

 1. FaceDetection_Basics : It contains the basic code to detect and track Faces and draw a bounding box with the Detection Confidence Score
 2. FaceDetectionModule  : The above file is converted into a Module, so that the code can be reused for future projects.
```
